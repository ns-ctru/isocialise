This study is a cluster RCT to investigate the effectiveness of LEGO®-based therapy for children with ASD. There will be an internal pilot study which will run for 10 months to examine the feasibility of recruitment. The pilot period will run for 10 months, at which point we expect to have recruited n=120 of which one third (n=40) will have reached the primary endpoint. Stop/Go criteria based on 75% of recruitment target (n=90) and 70% of the primary outcome measures (n=28) will be used to assess feasibility of continuing the trial. There is a nested economic evaluation, qualitative component and assessment of fidelity and acceptability.

### Primary Objective

The primary objective of this trial is to examine the clinical effectiveness of LEGO®-based therapy groups on the social and emotional competence (including perceived social skills, challenging behaviours and academic confidence) of children with ASD within a mainstream school setting, when compared with usual support provided for children with ASD.

### Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives of this trial are to:
1. Examine the clinical effectiveness of LEGO®-based therapy groups on the perceived social isolation and loneliness of children with ASD within the school setting, when compared with usual support provided.
2. Examine the cost-effectiveness of LEGO®-based therapy groups in terms of health-related quality of life and cost utility at 16 and 52 weeks.
3. Determine if the impact of LEGO®-based therapy is sustainable into the next academic year by measuring effectiveness 52 weeks after baseline.
4. Examine the acceptability of the intervention at follow-up points using a purpose designed questionnaire and telephone interviews.
5. Examine treatment fidelity through independent observation of treatment sessions across schools.

> The sample size calculation is based on the (Reichow et al., 2012) Cochrane review which reported on five studies that examined the effects of social skills groups on social competence. This context was selected as the best indicator of realistic clinical effectiveness on the basis that if the proposed intervention was to be viable it needs to be at least as effective as running a social skills group in school. Of the five studies included in this review, four were RCTs and reported standardised measures of social competence which could be synthesised through meta-analysis techniques. The weighted mean standardised difference in social competence between group treatment and services as usual was 0.47 (95% confidence interval from 0.16 to 0.78). Reichow, et al., (2012) argued that this average effect size of almost 0.5 of an SD corresponds to a clinically significant change, 'to put these gains in more concrete terms, if measuring everyday socials skills using the Vineland (Sparrow 2005) for example an average participant from these studies would increase their repertoire of social skills from 123 to 147 after participating in the social skills group which is a clinically significant increase'. Â Calculations using this standardised effect size of 0.47, 90% power and 5% two sided significance results in a sample size of 97 participant groups per condition or 194 participant groups in total. Attrition rates varied between 0% and 16% for the studies included in the (Reichow et al., 2012) Cochrane review. As such, a conservative estimate of 16% inflates the sample to a final size of 116 participant groups per condition or 232 in total. To account for trainer/school effects and a cluster size of approximately 2 participants per cluster (ICC=0.01), based on the findings of the ASSSIST feasibility study conducted in the York area (Wright et al., 2016) this figure was further inflated and rounded up to 120 participants groups per condition or 240 in total. We anticipate recruitment of 12 per month across all sites and have retention rate of 84% at 16 week follow-up. The pilot period will run for 10 months, at which point we expect to have recruited n=120 of which one third (n=40) will have reached the primary endpoint. Stop/Go criteria based on 75% of recruitment target (n=90) and 70% of the primary outcome measures (n=28) will be used to assess feasibility of continuing the trial.

It is argued that this practice is philosophically unsound, of no practical value and potentially misleading. Instead it is recommended that prognostic variables be identified in the trial-plan and fitted in an analysis of covariance regardless of their baseline distribution (statistical significance).}},

    abstract = {{In randomised trials, rather than comparing randomised groups directly some researchers carry out a significance test comparing a baseline with a final measurement separately in each group. We give several examples where this has been done. We use simulation to demonstrate that the procedure is invalid and also show this algebraically. This approach is biased and invalid, producing conclusions which are, potentially, highly misleading. The actual alpha level of this procedure can be as high as 0.50 for two groups and 0.75 for three. Randomised groups should be compared directly by two-sample methods and separate tests against baseline are highly misleading.}},

@article{altman1985,
    abstract = {{Randomised allocation in a clinical trial does not guarantee that the treatment groups are comparable with respect to baseline characteristics. It is common for differences between treatment groups to be assessed by significance tests but such tests only assess the correctness of the randomisation, not whether any observed imbalances between the groups might have affected the results of the trial. In particular, it is quite unjustified to conclude that variables that are not significantly differently distributed between groups cannot have affected the results of the trial.
 The possible effect of imbalance in a prognostic factor is considered, and it is shown that non-significant imbalances can exert a strong influence on the observed result of the trial, even when the risk associated with the factor is not all that great.
 It is suggested that comparability should be assessed partly on the basis of clinical  knowledge and that it is wise to investigate whether any imbalances between the groups could have had an affect by reanalysing the data taking such factors into  account. The implications for trial design are considered briefly.}},

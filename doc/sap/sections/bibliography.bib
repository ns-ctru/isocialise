    abstract = {{Randomised allocation in a clinical trial does not guarantee that the treatment groups are comparable with respect to baseline characteristics. It is common for differences between treatment groups to be assessed by significance tests but such tests only assess the correctness of the randomisation, not whether any observed imbalances between the groups might have affected the results of the trial. In particular, it is quite unjustified to conclude that variables that are not significantly differently distributed between groups cannot have affected the results of the trial.
 The possible effect of imbalance in a prognostic factor is considered, and it is shown that non-significant imbalances can exert a strong influence on the observed result of the trial, even when the risk associated with the factor is not all that great.
 It is suggested that comparability should be assessed partly on the basis of clinical  knowledge and that it is wise to investigate whether any imbalances between the groups could have had an affect by reanalysing the data taking such factors into  account. The implications for trial design are considered briefly.}},

    abstract = {{The case for preferring analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to the simple analysis of change scores (SACS) has often been made. Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

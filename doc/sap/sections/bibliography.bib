It is common for differences between treatment groups to be assessed by significance tests but such tests only assess the correctness of the randomisation, not whether any observed imbalances between the groups might have affected the results of the trial. In particular, it is quite unjustified to conclude that variables that are not significantly differently distributed between groups cannot have affected the results of the trial.
 The possible effect of imbalance in a prognostic factor is considered, and it is shown that non-significant imbalances can exert a strong influence on the observed result of the trial, even when the risk associated with the factor is not all that great.
 It is suggested that comparability should be assessed partly on the basis of clinical  knowledge and that it is wise to investigate whether any imbalances between the groups could have had an affect by reanalysing the data taking such factors into  account. The implications for trial design are considered briefly.}},

    abstract = {{The case for preferring analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to the simple analysis of change scores (SACS) has often been made. Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents?including figures, tables, and so on?can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or ?source? document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution, and use of such reproducible research are discussed.}},

Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health. 10.1093/aje/kwj093}},

Methods\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The EQ-5D-Y was administered in population samples of children and adolescents in Germany, Italy, South Africa, Spain, and Sweden. Percentages of missing values and reported problems were calculated. Test–retest reliability was determined. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients with other generic measures of HRQOL were calculated. Known groups' validity was examined by comparing groups with a priori expected differences in HRQOL. Results\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Between 91 and 100\% of the respondents provided valid scorings. Sweden had the lowest proportion of reported problems (1–24.9\% across EQ-5D-Y dimensions), with the highest proportions in South Africa (2.8–47.3\%) and Italy (4.3–39.0\%). Percentages of agreement in test–retest reliability ranged between 69.8 and 99.7\% in the EQ-5D-Y dimensions; Kappa coefficients were up to 0.67. Correlation coefficients with other measures of self-rated health indicated convergent validity (up to r\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;−0.56). Differences between groups classified according to presence of chronic conditions, self-rated overall health and psychological problems provided preliminary evidence of known groups' validity. Conclusions\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Results provide preliminary evidence of the instrument's feasibility, reliability and validity. Further study is required in clinical samples and for possible future applications in economic analyses.}},

An international task force revised the content of EQ-5D and wording to ensure relevance and clarity for young respondents. Children's and adolescents' understanding of the EQ-5D-Y was tested in cognitive interviews after the instrument was translated into German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish. Differences between the EQ-5D and the EQ-5D-Y regarding frequencies of reported problems were investigated in Germany, Spain and South Africa. The content of the EQ-5D dimensions proved to be appropriate for the measurement of HRQOL in young respondents. The wording of the questionnaire had to be adapted which led to small changes in the meaning of some items and answer options. The adapted EQ-5D-Y was satisfactorily understood by children and adolescents in different countries. It was better accepted and proved more feasible than the EQ-5D. The administration of the EQ-5D and of the EQ-5D-Y causes differences in frequencies of reported problems. The newly developed EQ-5D-Y is a useful tool to measure HRQOL in young people in an age-appropriate manner.}},

    abstract = {{To test whether or not adults assign the same values to hypothetical health states that describe health in adults as when those same descriptions refer to the health of a child. A two-part self-completion questionnaire was designed in which respondents were asked firstly to rate a fixed set of EQ-5D-Y health states on a 0-100 visual analogue scale as if they themselves were in these states. Two versions of the questionnaire were produced each with a different second part. One version instructed respondents to value the same states but to imagine them describing another adult. The second version required respondents to value these states as if they applied to a 10-year-old child. Questionnaires were distributed to adults recruited in three countries (Germany, Spain and England) using convenience sampling methods. A total of 1085 questionnaires were completed. Despite some significant differences in the characteristics of the achieved samples in the three countries involved, the rank order of health states was largely consistent across each adult/child reference perspective. In all countries, the mean values were lower when health states described children rather than adults. Significant differences were found for 16/24 states when values for those states applied to adult respondent themselves were compared with the values for those states applied to a 10-year-old child. A near-uniform pattern was found across all three countries in which health state values for children were found to be lower than for adults. Values for health states when ascribed to adults are higher than when those same states are associated with children. Were EQ-5D-3L values for adults applied to EQ-5D-Y health states, then this would effectively lead to an misrepresentation of the value assigned to a health status in children.}},

Whilst there are measures widely used for this purpose in adults, research in the paediatric field is more limited. This paper reports on how the descriptive system for a new paediatric generic PBM of HRQoL was developed from dimensions identified in previous research. Methods\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Existing scales from the paediatric literature were reviewed for suitability, and scales were also developed empirically, based on qualitative interview data from children, by taking adverbial phrases and confirming the ordinality by a ranking exercise with children. The resulting scales were applied to the dimensions from the previous research. Results\&nbsp;\&nbsp;No suitable scales were found in the paediatric literature, so the empirically derived scales were used resulting in seven different types. Children were successfully able to rank these to determine the ordinality, and these types were applied to the dimensions. Conclusions\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This work has empirically developed a descriptive system for the dimensions of HRQoL identified in previous research. Further research is needed to test the descriptive system on a paediatric population and reduce the number of dimensions to be amenable to health state valuation.}},

@article{furber2015,
    abstract = {{Background:\&\#10;Few cost-utility studies of child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) use quality adjusted life years (a combination of utility weights and time in health state) as the outcome to enable comparison across disparate programs and modalities. Part of the solution to this problem involves embedding preference-based health-related quality of life (PBHRQOL) utility instruments, which generate utility weights, in clinical practice and research. The Child Health Utility (CHU9D) is a generic PBHRQOL instrument developed specifically for use in young people. The purpose of this study was to assess the suitability of the CHU9D as a routine outcome measure in CAMHS clinical practice.\&\#10;Methods:\&\#10;Two hundred caregivers of children receiving community mental health services completed the CHU9D alongside a standardised child and adolescent mental health measure (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire \&\#19; SDQ) during a telephone interview. We investigated face validity, practicality, internal consistency, and convergent validity of the CHU9D. In addition, we compared the utility weights obtained in this group with utility weights from other studies of child and adolescent mental health populations.\&\#10;Results:\&\#10;Participants found the CHU9D easy and quick to complete. It demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, and correlated moderately with the SDQ. It was able to discriminate between children in the abnormal range and those in the non-clinical/borderline range as measured by the SDQ. Three CHU9D items without corollaries in the SDQ (sleep, schoolwork, daily routine) were found to be significant predictors of the SDQ total score and may be useful clinical metrics. The mean utility weight of this sample was comparable with clinical subsamples from other CHU9D studies, but was significantly higher than mean utility weights noted in other child and adolescent mental health samples.\&\#10;Conclusions:\&\#10;Initial validation suggests further investigation of the CHU9D as a routine outcome measure in CAMHS is warranted. Further investigation should explore test-retest reliability, sensitivity to change, concordance between caregiver and child-completed forms, and the calibration of the utility weights. Differences between utility weights generated by the CHU9D and other utility instruments in this population should be further examined by administering a range of PBHRQOL instruments concurrently in a mental health group.}},

<!-- ## General Approach -->

<!-- **NB** The following section is copied directly from the study protocol (`r study$protocol_version`) and is included for completeness. -->

<!-- > As this trial is a pragmatic cluster RCT, data will be analysed and reported according to both RCT and cluster RCT CONSORT guidelines [@schulz2010b, @campbell2012]. Baseline demographic (e.g. age, gender) and outcome measures (e.g. SDQ) will be assessed for comparability between groups. -->

<!-- No formal statistical tests will be performed for differences, rather visual inspection and comparison of tabulated numbers will be performed and as is best practice, adjustments will be made for important baseline characteristics by including them as co-variates [@bland2011, @senn2006, @vickers2001b, @vickers2001, @kaiser1989]. -->

<!-- **INPUT REQUIRED** - It should be possible to say up front what baseline co-variates will be included for adjustment, need these documented.  I'd suggest that for each outcome its corresponding baseline value is included, age and gender too.  Beyond that I'm unsure and require input from the TMG. -->

<!-- > We will use ITT analysis for all outcome measures, that is those who withdraw from the treatment but complete outcome measures will be included in the analyses. This is the most appropriate form of analysis for a pragmatic trial as it maximises the external validity of the data despite the danger of dilution bias [@torgerson2008]. Hence we can evaluate the evidence that the intervention has an effect on the social competence and perceived social isolation of children with ASD within a school setting. -->

<!-- **NB** The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) has advised/requested that a Per-Protocol analyses be performed  as well.  The last Trial Management Group (TMG) meeting 2017-10-25 it was agreed that to meet the protocol participants had to complete 50% of the therapy sessions.  The protocol (`r study$protocol_version`) needs updating to reflect this and once that has been done I'll update the text based on what is written there, or the following suggested text can be appended to the existing statement... -->

<!-- > A Per-Protocol (PP) sensitivity analysis will be performed including only those individuals who attended and completed 50% of the Lego Therapy session, although it is noted that the post-randomisation exclusion of individuals can lead to bias and an inflation in [type I errors (false positive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#Type_I_error) [@lachin2000]. -->



### Primary and Secondary Outcomes Analysis

The primary outcome will be the associated teacher reported SSIS score measured at 16 weeks. SSIS is a summated score which we will treat as a continuous variable. All measures will be compared between the two treatment groups using a generalised linear mixed model to account for the clustering and the repeated measures.  We will include the following variables as covariates: age, sex, baseline SSIS, school (random effect) and school level (stratification variable: primary or secondary school). An unadjusted analysis (difference between group means and 95% confidence intervals) will be reported alongside the adjusted analysis. The significance level with be set at 5% for testing the primary outcome.

The secondary outcome variables will also be treated as continuous variables and analysed (adjusting for baseline score, age, sex, school level (stratification variable) and school (random effect)) using the generalised linear mixed model framework.

## Statistical Details

### Conduct of Work

In accordance with Sheffield CTRU Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) *ST001 The Statistical Analysis Plan* all work is conducted under the principle of [Reproducible Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).  After extracting the raw, unlinked data from the [CTRU Prospect database](https://www.ctru-prospect.shef.ac.uk/) the data will be re-linked and analysed using the statistical software [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and Statistical Reports produced using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to ensure reproducibility, self-documentation and minimise errors occurring when using calculated statistics (since they can be inserted directly into text rather than transposed by hand to a Word Document, a tedious and error prone practice).  The main Statistical report will be provided in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) as this provides a universal, Operating-System agnostic and easily transferable medium and is a neater method of presenting the wide array of information the study will generate than more traditional linear documents such as PDF or Word which can stretch to hundreds of pages in length (although because of the flexibility offered by [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)/[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) PDF and Word versions will also be produced).

It is anticipated that the exact tables and figures produced in the Statistical report will not be those required for the funders report nor for any peer-reviewed publications that arise from this work and that dedicated reports produced using RMarkdown and fully reproducible will be produced for each proposed publicatoin and written in conjunction with other researchers.


## Detailed Statistical Analyses

### Summary Statistics

Tables and graphs summarising the baseline and follow-up measurements at 16 and 52 weeks  by treatment arm and overall will be produced (see Appendix for examples), although no formal test for imbalances at baseline will be peformed as they are redundant and inflate the possibility of false positives, rather clinical knowledge of what is important to adjust for should guide selection of baseline covariates to be included in the model [@roberts1999, @senn1995, @senn1994, @altman1985].  No formal tests for statistical differences will be performed on the univariable outcomes as it provides unadjusted estimates of treatment effect which will be modified when adjusted for baseline and other covariates in the multivariable Generalised Linear Mixed Model.

```{r child = 'tables/summary.Rmd', eval = TRUE}
```

### Statistical Modelling

Generalised Linear Mixed Models will be fitted using the [`lme4`](https://github.com/lme4/lme4/) package for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to estimate the effect of LEGO-based therapy compared to normal treatment on the stated outcome(s) as recorded at follow-up and adjusting for baseline.  Change from baseline should not be used as it is less powerful than a direct comparison at the follow-up time point and adjusting for individuals baseline measurement [@bland2011, @senn2006, @vickers2001b, @vickers2001, @kaiser1989].  The output of individual models will be presented along with graphical representations and diagnostic plots to assess model fit and validity (see Appendix for examples).  To allow for intra-class correlation (ICC) that may arise from the delivery of the LEGO-based therapy in groups random effects will be included for schools, the unit of clustering and also therapist to allow for variation introduced by having multiple therapists at the same school which may arise if there are >3 eligible participants at any given school.

In keeping with best practice [@vickers2012], assessment tools that produce scores on a numeric bounded scale will be analysed as such rather than categorising into two or more arbitrary categories (for more on problems with this approach see also [here](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/CatContinuous)), however if there is evidence of non-linearity flexible parametric approaches will be investigated.

**ToDo** Methods for non-linearity, perhaps [regression splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_adaptive_regression_splines)?

**ToDo** 2017-08-30 - It was mentioned that there is some video analysis to be performed blinded by two independent assessors and that the Inter Rater Reliability will be calculated.  Is this something that should be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

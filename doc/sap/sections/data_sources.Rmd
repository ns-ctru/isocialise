### Eligibility, Inclusion and Exclusion

Eligibility, inclusion and exclusion will have been assessed at the recruitment stage and is therefore of little relevance to the Statistical Analysis Plan, although there is some scope for checking the criteria based on collected data.  For that reason the criterai are included below.

**NB** The following section is copied directly from the study protocol (`r study$protocol_version`) and whilst it it has little bearing on the statsitical analyses themselves it is included for completeness.

#### Inclusion Criteria

> A participant will be included if the child:
>
> * Is aged between 7 and 15 years (based on previous research and extensive PPI recommendations)
> * Attends a mainstream school in years 2-10.
> * The child and parent/ guardian have a sufficient understanding of English to be able to provide informed consent and read the LEGO®-based therapy instructions.
> * Has an ASD clinical diagnosis from a qualified assessing clinician or team based on best-practice guidance leading to an ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1993) or DSM-IV diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)] as reported by the child’s parent/ guardian and in the child’s school records (this may include the school’s special educational needs (SEN) register, an individual education plan (IEP), individual health care plan, my support plan (MSPs), education health care plans (EHCPs), individual learning plans (ILP’s) or equivalent)
> * Scores 15 or higher on the Social Communication Questionnaire.
> * Has the ability to follow and understand simple instructions (as determined by the associated teacher/ TA or parent/ guardian).
>
> A school will be included if:
>
> * It is a mainstream school located in one of the three recruiting sites - Leeds, York, or Sheffield
> * It has not used LEGO®-based therapy with the child in the current or preceding school term.
> * They have at least one child diagnosed with ASD (in line with child inclusion criteria above).

#### Exclusion Criteria

> A participant would not be included in the study if:
>
> * They have physical impairments which would prevent them participating in the activities (assessed by the associated teacher/TA).
> * The child and parent/ guardian do not have a sufficient understanding of English to be able to provide informed consent and read the LEGO®-based therapy instructions.

## Analysis Populations

```{r child = 'tables/analysis_populations.Rmd', include = TRUE}
```

**Per Protocol**
A participant in the Lego-therapy group is defined as Per-Protocol (PP) if...

* They attend 50% of the therapy sessions.

A participant in the normal treatment group can not violate the protocol.

### Role of Populations

**INPUT REQUIRED** - Copied from ASPECT SAP but this isn't a non-inferiority, its a superiority trial, unaware of citaion that recommends PP/ITT.

It is recommended both Per-Protocol (PP) and Intention To Treat (ITT) analyses are performed for non-inferiorty designs [@jones1996].  This is because in a comparative trial where the aim is to decide if two treatments are different an ITT analysis is generally conservative, as the inclusion of protocol violators and withdrawals will usually make the results from the4 two treatment groups similar.  However, for equivalence or non-inferiority trails this effect is no longer conservative, any blurring of the difference between teh treatment groups will increase the chance of declaring equivalence.  We follow this recommendation with the refinement that the main analysis of the primary outcome will be per-protocol with sensitivy analysis on the ITT population.

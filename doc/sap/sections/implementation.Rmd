This SAP will be used as a work description for the statistician involved in the trial.  All analyses should ideally be performed by the same statistician under the supervision of the senior statistician and consequently none of the investigators involved in the trial will perform any statistical analyses.

Initially the data manager will provide blinded data for preliminary checiks by the statistician, this will be used to develop scripts to combine and merge the data into a coherent and cogent labelled data set with defined analysis sets suitable for statistical analysis in advance of receiving the final data set for analysis.  Following database freeze unblinded data will be delivered to the statistician and any queries will be communicated to the data manager prior to database locka and required changes documented.  After agreement between the statistician, data manager and study manager the database will be locked and it is expected that no data amendments will be made.  If however amendments are required the process will be documented as described in CTRU SOP DM012.

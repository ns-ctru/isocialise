## Pilot Endpoint

As detailed above, the internal pilot phase will be considered successful and the study will continue if at 10 months...

- 90 participants have been recruited.
- 28 recruited participants have primary outcome measures.

**ToDo** Protocol states (as above) that the available data...

> will be used to assess feasibility of continuing the trail.

...but is not explicit on what the criteria for assessment will be.  **Input Required**

## Primary Outcome

* Social Skills Improvement System assessed by the Teacher/Teaching Assistant at 16 weeks.

## Secondary Outcomes

A host of additional assessment tools are being used and form the basis of the Secondary Outcomes.  Details of their scoring and the handling of missing data are detailed in Section ###).

**ToDo** Citations for these, does anyone have these in a citation database (Mendley, CiteULike, BibTeX) which can be used?

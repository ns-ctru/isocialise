**NB** The following section is copied directly from the study protocol (`r study$protocol_version`) it is included for completeness.

> The RCT will contain a ten month internal pilot.  At the end of this period the trial team will report to the NIHR on whether criteria for stopping have been met and whether the trial should continue.  Sheffield CTRU will aggregate study data to assess feasibility of the research.  Stop/Go criteria (see below) will be based on the feasibility of recruitment, retention and safety outcomes.  We anticipate a recruitment rate of 12 children (six schools) per month.  At ten months we would have expected to recruit 120 children and we will include a stopping criterion of 75% of the recruitment target (n = 90) will be set.  One third of the recruited participants would have reached the primary endpoint (n = 40) and we will expect 70% of outcome measures up to this point to have been completed (n = 28).  As the trial exposes children with autism to a novel social situation, a Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will review the data at the end of the pilot and through the trial for safey.  If there is evidence ofharm due to the interventions or measures the trial may be stopped.

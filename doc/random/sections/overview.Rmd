The study protocol states that randomisation is to be stratified by school type (`Primary` v's `Secondary`) because the later are much more likely to be larger in size relative to the former, certainly in terms of total number of students which in turn may be reflected by the number of elligible participants that could be recruited to the study.  It has been noted (see email `2017-07-27` from [Katie Biggs](mailto:k.biggs@sheffield.ac.uk) subject `I-SOCIALISE randomisation`) that subsequent to study funding and protocol...

> We had a meeting yesterday and discussed the fact that there seem to be a number of schools that have more than the estimated 1-2 children with autism. There seems to be a range of numbers in each school, with one secondary school potentially having 20 eligible children, though more commonly there are between 1 and 6. Dani and Sarah can work on the averages if you need better estimates than that!

> The following was raised:
> * Will this effect the sample size - as a cluster the sample has been worked out from the number of schools (as 120) but we may need less than that with these numbers?
> * As we are not stratifying on number of children could this lead to an imbalance in group numbers and will this be a problem?

This was also discussed at the Trial Steering Committee meeting held 2017-08-02 14:00-16:00 where it was noted that out of XX schools invited to participate XX had expressed an interest.  York study manager [Dani Varley](mailto:danielle.varley@nhs.net) has provided a list of the size of the schools that have expressed an interest in participation and the distribution is summarised.  To account for the impact this may have on randomisation i.e. some schools have larger clusters (although therapy groups will be maintained at a constant size which introduces a secondary, nested, level of clustering which can be accounted for during analysis) a second level of stratification has been introduced based on whether a recruited school has >3 eligible participants.

** Protocol : Clarify that week 52 should be excluded from section 10.3 on pg41
*** David Cottrell
**** Primary endpoint SSIS 16 or 52 weeks.  Need to choose only one and mention it in the Summary.
**** Summary should list all secondary outcomes, need clarity on linking the outcome measures to the objectives.
**** Agreed that 16 weeks follow-up should be primary, 52 weeks secondary.
**** Is SSIS an appropriate instrument?
**** How does SSIS change across age?
***** Barry   : It has been validated across all age groups, but unknown how it changes across these age groups.  We'll have to check how
**** Is it correct that the teachers are unblind to the primary?  Clarify in the
***** Barry   : Yes since the teachers are delivering and will be performing the assessment of SSIS for the primary outcome.  Parents are blind either.
***** David   : May be risk of unconcious bias.
***** Barry   : It may be possible but very difficult to blind schools, and those who record the outcome measure.
**** How is randomisation to occur?  Approach schools and randomise them, or only after interested parents have been identified?
***** Barry   : Not randomising schools until after baseline has been taken.  Ensure there is a therapy group in place.
**** Stratifying and imbalances?
***** Neil    : We are stratifying by primary/secondary to control for some of this problem as Secondary are likely to have larger clusters.
***** Barry   :
***** Fiona   : Important to get the right number of clusters.  Additional complexity added by multiple groups/therapists.  Adjustsing by age varying and baseline.
**** Is there likely to be heterogeneity across sites/areas?
***** Barry   : Trying to avoid possibility of over stratifying.
***** Barry   : Special schools for autism are excluded, but those with dedicated support are included.
***** ACTION  : Possibly stratify on the type of school, how many have there been repsonding that are 'special' schools and is this something that we can stratify on.
**** How is fidelity to be assessed?  At what stage in the process is it to be conducted?
***** Barry   : Not supervision.
***** Barry   : Self reporting of how the sessions went.  Train the trainers established who are specialist in autism spectrum, and they have buy-in to the intervention.
***** Barry   : Training will be available on an on-going basis and for new staff recruiting to deliver them who will need training.
*** Michael Morton
**** Interested to know whether the primary measure has been used in conjunction with other secondary outcomes, as its reassuring that the change in conjunction with each other?
***** No one could answer this.
***** David   : Its difficult to measure social skills without being blinded for many of the outcomes.
**** Acceptability questionnaire, will it be one of the reasons for pulling the trial?
***** Barry   : Reporting any problems of whether the intervention is acceptable
***** Michael : Will childrens stigma and like/dislike in the study by noted.
***** Cindy   : Yes
**** What part does the fidelity check list play, it should be self-reguating as it will record each session that is delivered.
***** Barry   : We will be monitoring as we go along.
***** David   : Measure attendance, and administrative aspects.  Some video analysis may also be of use. As well as Train the Trainer.
***** Cindy   : Could look at whether....
***** Barry   : Check with trin the trainer as to what they are planning on doing to keep the trainers on-track.
***** Barry   : We can use our staff who already deliver the training to see what she does (Anne) and adopt that.
**** Adverse Events may have larger impacts.
***** Cindy   : Asking broadly by asking teachers and parents what has happened.
***** Michael : Check list in place but perhaps not totally approriate.
***** Cindy   :
**** Any specific points raised by the ethcs committee that the TSC should be aware of?
***** Barry   : Fairly straight-forward and have been addressed
*** Fiona Warren
**** What about conflict between children and parent/guardian with regards to consent?
***** Barry   : Legal sense, if they are > 12/13 then child can consent, if less than that they have to have parent/guardian.  Aim to have consent from both.
***** Cindy   : Clarify this in the protocol.
**** EQ-5D-3L is being used, what abotu the 5L
***** Cindy   : Colleagues at ScHARR have been looking at the comparability of the two and scoring in the target population.
***** Katie   : EUROQOL advised to use the 3L
**** Delay between baseline and starting therapy? I.e. timing of baseline.
***** David   : If recruitment during holidays then baseline is at the start of therapy.
***** Barry   : Aim to minimise
**** How many interventionists at each school?
***** Barry   : One interventionist per three children.
***** David   : Ah, but you could have one interventionist with multiple groups, this might interfere with clustering.
***** Neil    : Perhaps consider clustering at the interventionist level.
***** David   : What if there aren't sufficient ASD children in the group?
***** Barry   : Bulk out with other children (with consent to participate, but no outcomes) to make up the numbers to a group of three.
***** Michael : If children without ASD, will enough be done to avoid harming the children (minimise Adverse Events)
***** Barry   : Some debate over including 'normal' children, developed assessment criteria for inclusion of these additional children.
**** Is data on which children with whom being recorded?
***** Barry   : Yes.
**** What about clusters dropping out?  A waiting list for replacing clusters that are lost? May have imbalanced drop-out
***** Barry   : Unlikely to be a huge impact as some.
***** NEIL    : Impact of losing clusters, it will reduce power, and more of an impact that anything else.  Larger
**** Are the Research Assistants blinded?
***** Barry   : Yes, Research Assistants are blinded.  Need to add this to the protocol, and record where they are inadvertantely blinded.
**** Gender balance, what is the expected ratio, will it affect the delivery of the intervention?
***** Barry   : Would expect more male than female, roughly 2-3:1 no idea if there will be bias in those coming forward for the therapy.  No intention to divide them, but teachers can choose to form groups from those who are likely to work together.  Facilitator is meant to encourage them and the whole intervention is that they are to work together, which will address the problem Fiona is concerned about (gender based differences in interacting).
**** Recording reasons for delining to participate?
***** Katie   : Yes where possible, letter are sent out, we won't know why if they don't respond.  If we have contact with them and they choose not to participate information will be illicited
**** School types
***** Dani    : Can't include indepndant schools
***** Michael : Problems with specialist schools (who are likely to be keen).
**** Missing data by virtue of online survery?
***** Katie   : Online form will be strict not allowing fields to not be removed.
**** Effect size is there Minimal Clinically Important Difference for the SSIS in target population?  Is 123 to 147 a change that is noticeable?
***** Barry   : Children with such a change would be noticed.
***** TODO Barry   : Addressed this in the meeting explaining that the Reichow's estimate is a clinically meaningful.
**** ICC estimated from????  How any clusters in the study on which it was based, what is the effect of varying ICC (perhaps in the range of the CI from the other study).
***** TODO Ask Dawn for details of sample size calculation and repeat using varying ICC.
**** Any definition of Per-Protocol, as there may be some drop-out.
***** Neil    : Nothing there yet.
***** Barry   : We can discuss whether to include this, need
***** ACTION  : Look at how we define protocol adherance and include these analyses.
*** Sue
**** Will bespoke questionnaires be used to assess usage across studies?
***** Barry   :
***** Cindy   : Resource usage at week 52 is being utilised.
***** David   : With luck the randomised aspect will balance this out.
***** Barry   : Resources
**** Informational video?
***** Barry   : Considered but its Â£6000 and no funds available.
**** Lone working procedure for RA
***** Barry   : Yes these are in place.
**** What training will the independant fidelity raters have?
***** Barry   : One has a lot of experience of the
**** Will anonymised data be available?
***** Cindy   : Data sharing policy will need to be developed.
**** Any autistic representatives in PPI?
***** Barry   : Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder are on the Trial Management Group.  Children have been spoken to.
*** TODO Protocol Approval by Trial Steering Committee
**** Make Changes and suggestions pretty soon.
**** Clarify outcomes
**** Per Protocol should e mentioned in the protocol as well as the Statistical Analysis Plan.
**** Need to prioritise how (or if) we are further stratifying the data based on school sizes.
**** Number of schools and individuals, as well as the type (Junior/Secondary)
**** Statistical Analysis Plan
***** TODO I will have this in place by xmas.  It should align with a HEAP
**** Health Economics Analysis Plan should also be in place, being done by York, so need to liase with them.
** Sample Size in light of clustering
*** Responding schools have between 1-6 and upto 20 elligible participants
* 2017-07-31 Dawn Statistical Analaysis                          :statistics:
** TODO Randomisation and school clusters
*** TODO Katie as asked about the effect clusters larger than those anticipated will have on the study.
*** TODO Dawn suggests that because we have to have consent of participants prior to randomising them we could stratify further (beyond the existing Primary/Secondary) on there being >3 participants.
*** TODO Incorporate this in the randomisation, but what does this mean in terms of power/sample size?
*** TODO The ICC may be higher if there are larger clusters, this in turn might inflate the sample size further.  And to answer this we need to know what the likelihood is of having clusters >2???  Ask this on Wednesday, any experience from Assist?
*** TODO IS there any clustering in the control arm?  If so this might revise the sample size.
*** TODO Based on preious discussions (Dawn) they felt that it unlikely that all of the eligible students will be recruited.  May already have been discussed.  The two per school is estimated on 1-6 at each school.
*** TODO BMJ Open paper https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/8/e011748.full.pdf
** TODO Statistical Analysis Plan
*** TODO First draft in plae with lots of copy and paste from the Protocol.
**** TODO Protocol stats that repeated measures is primary outcome, but need to remove this as its just 16 weeks.
